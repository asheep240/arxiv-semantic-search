## Intro
Research is often an inefficient, time-consuming endeavor. When approaching new concepts, obtaining background knowledge requires a student or researcher to read through many long papers before they can begin their own work. In light of this inefficiency, this is an application to provide graduate students and researchers with an efficient means of obtaining answers to questions during the course of their research. A user can input a natural language query, and by reading data from papers most relevant to the query and contextualizing it, the program provides a response explaining in natural language the answer to the question. Especially when researchers are not familiar with the complexities of issues that have already been answered, this will expedite research processes by removing the need to comb through extensive databases for research papers, and will significantly reduce the time required to gain preliminary knowledge, making research more accessible.

## How it works

This project uses an OpenAI API return a response to a user query based on context from matched arXiv/bioRxiv papers.
